Summary
=======

After completion of this lab, you should get experience with EVPN implementation of L2 / L3 connectivity inside the fabric and as well with use case, where we need to connect fabric with external network. As part of the lab, we went also thru some problematic scenarios, so we could present you not only configuration examples where you will setup the fabric, but as well give you opportunity to troubleshoot common issues in EVPN fabric.

We hope that you will find content of this lab useful and that you will be able to use gained experience in your daily job.
